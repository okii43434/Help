Im 15 year old and i need to build a website for our research project. Our deadline is Feb 1st
I do not have friends at school and I only have myself to code our website

my firebase auth is not working. I tried creating users but it doesnt show up in the console. I also can't sign in even if i created an account directly to the firebase console

Thank you for the help!
